# Tourism recommendation system
## Discription :
Welcome, This is Tourism recommendation system in which you can predict the tour worthy location of your liking  from ratings of the places from the people who visited previously.
## How to use : 
* Clone this repository to your system
* Run the .ipynb file of the particular location to predict in jupyter notebook or google colab.
* Give your input in the custom data list and then run the file.
* Get output about whether the location is prefrable or not.
## About the dataset
* Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritvik1909/indian-places-to-visit-reviews-data
* These datasets have seriously large amount of data so that we can get good accuracy score using different models.
## Step followed
### Importing the libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
## Loading the dataset.
### Preprocessing the data :
* We cleaned the data by removing the irrelevant features.
* Removed null values.
* Splitted the dataset using in train and test form using train test split.
### Data Visualization :
* Used matplotlib to seaborn to visualize the data
* By visualizing the data we got to know which features play the most important role in deciding the output of the model.
## Using Models :
* Decision Tree
## Predicting the data :
* We predictied the model on X_train and then tested it on Y_test.
* We also gave custom input to the model and it prediciting with a good accuracy.
